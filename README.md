# Proof of Existence Dapp
Proof of Existence Dapp for Consensys Developer Program 2018-19

This dapp allows users with a web3 enabled browser (or web3 injecting plugin like Metamask) to upload a time-stamped image/video to prove existence of some information. Files are uploaded to IPFS, and are therefore public.

Users can add a file, input tags separated by commas, and on clicking Upload, a link to their uploaded proof is displayed in the User History section.

The dapp detects users account address, and fetches previously uploaded proofs along with their tags.
